# write R code that replicates the functionality of the head function we used in bash. Your 
# code should define a variable with the file to return lines from and a variable representing 
# number of lines to be returned from the top of the indicated file. The selected file content 
# should be printed to the terminal in R. Do not use the head function in R. Be sure you are 
# using square bracket indexing to subset the tabular file. 

# create a data frame that contains tree species name and their relative abundance 
names <- c("Acer","Populous","Betula","Fraxinus")
sppAbundance <- c(182, 121, 33, 17)
woodDensity <- c(0.62, 0.26, 0.33, 0.41)
df <- data.frame(names, sppAbundance, woodDensity, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# I would like to see first and fourth row and first, second and third column of the dataframe
subset <- df[c(1,4),c(1,2,3)]
print(subset)

# set working directory 
setwd("C:\\Users\\debit\\Downloads\\Stem decay project")

# read iris.csv data set
iris <- read.csv("iris.csv")

# print the last two rows and last two columes to the R terminal 
print(iris[c(149:150),c(4,5)])

# get the number of observations for each species included in the data set
setosaNum <- nrow(subset(iris, Species == "setosa"))
versicolorNum <- nrow(subset(iris, Species == "versicolor"))
VerginicaNum <- nrow(subset(iris, Species == "virginica"))

# get rows with Sepal.Width > 3.5 
sepalwidth <- iris[iris$Sepal.Width > 3.5, ]

# write the data for the species setosa for a comma-delimited file names 'setosa.csv'
setosa <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa", ]
write.csv(setosa, "setosa.csv", row.names=FALSE)

# calculate the mean, minimum and maximum of Petal.Length for observations from virginica 
verginica <- iris[iris$Species == "virginica", ]
mean <-  mean(verginica$Petal.Length)
minimum <- min(verginica$Petal.Length)
maximum <- max(verginica$Petal.Length)
